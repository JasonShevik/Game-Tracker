To do list:

Initiative tracker:
* Implement the wiki database with custom monster popups
* On the monster popups include a button that launches the wiki page in default browser
* Incorporate the Dice Manager into the MenuBar of Initiative Tracker once the Dice are done
* Add Insets so that it's not so cramped.

Wiki grabber:
* Allow spellcasting (as in Abominable Yeti Mage)


Dice:
* Finish the event stuff for ComboPopup.
* Do the ResultsPopup class.


Loot:
* Make Loot.java attempt to automatically load a default database if there is one in the same directory
* Fix the loot table and test this module against that version
